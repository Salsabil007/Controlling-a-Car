# Controlling-a-Car
It is a small project that controls a simulated car. It has three part. 
In the first part, the code lets a car jump over a grove of trees.
In second part, the code lets a car navigate a circular track depending on the relation between steering angle and turning radius.
In the third part, I have implemented the parallel parking function of a car.
