# Controlling-a-Car
It is a fun project to control a simulated car. It has three part. 
In the first part, the code lets a car jump over a grove of trees.
In second part, the code lets a car navigate a circular track depending on the relation between steering angle and turning radius.
In the third part, I have implemented the parallel parking function of a car.

////// .ipynb files sometimes behave strange. They don't open and show, " something went wrong. Reload? " 
Opening the file in new tap most of the time solves the problem. 
again, you can try this links to solve the problem:

All the best :)
